Hello! Below is a link to a page that contains some of the projects I did in High School. I was lucky enough to have a class and teacher that let me explore whatever topic in CS that I desired. I used a lot of Processing, a visual programming language based on Java, to complete more visual projects. Also included is a couple of rudimentary websites I made as my interest in web development grew, as well as a bit about a reasearch project I did involving genetic data analysis in senior year.
